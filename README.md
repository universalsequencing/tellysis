## Overview

Tellysis provides three data analysis pipelines to process Linked Read data generated by TELL-Seq technology.

* Tell-Read
Tell-Read data analysis pipeline takes output data produced by Illumina Sequencers using TELL-Seq Library Prep Kits. The pipeline performs quality control processing on barcodes, generates TELL-Seq linked reads and reports the performance on barcode and DNA sequencing reads.
